#+RESULTS:

** History
+ Initial motivation [2018-02-22 Thu]
  + This is based on earlier programs such as ~find-xy-shell.py~ and ~fit-circle-shell.py~
  + It is a ground-up rewrite to make sure that the description in Appendix E of the "Bow shock shapes" paper is actually correct
  + We will take the opportunity to make it more general
  + And use the new astropy-affiliated ~regions~ package
